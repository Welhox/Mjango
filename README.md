# So_long(and thanks for the fish)

My first interactive program, including graphics. 

This project was about creating a simple 2D game using the MLX42 graphics library. 

It involved map parsing, basic animations, game functions and learning how the graphic library works. 

In the game you play as the interdimensional cat Mjango, who is in quite the pickle. 
She finds herself in the duck dimension with a empty tummy, and a black hole looming over the horizon. 
Will she have enough time to eat all the ducks so that she can survive through the black hole?
