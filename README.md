# Mjango

> *So long, and thanks for the ducks!*

My first interactive program with graphics.  
This project was about creating a simple **2D top-down game** using the **MLX42 graphics library**.  

It involved:
- Map parsing  
- Basic animations  
- Game functions  
- Learning how the graphics library works

## 🎮 The Game

You play as **Mjango**, the interdimensional cat who is in quite the pickle.  
She finds herself in the **Duck Dimension** with an empty tummy, and a black hole looming on the horizon.  

Your task:
- Collect all the ducks 🦆  
- Reach the black hole 🕳️  
- Escape… if you’re fast (and full) enough!

## 🛠️ Features

- **Top-down perspective** with grid-based movement  
- **Collectibles** (ducks)  
- **Exit condition** (black hole)  
- **Basic animations** for player and environment  
- **Map parsing** from external `.ber` files  

---

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Compile the game**:
   ```bash
   make

3. **Run with a map file**:
   ```bash
   ./mjango maps/example.ber

5. **Controls**:
   - `WASD` / arrow keys → move Mjango  
   - `ESC` → quit game

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project I learned:
- How to work with **MLX42** for graphics  
- Implementing **basic game logic** and **state machines**  
- Parsing and validating **map files**  
- Handling **animations** and **event loops**  
- Writing my first **interactive graphical program**

## 📝 Notes

- This project was originally named **so_long** as part of the [42 Network](https://42.fr) curriculum.  
- Renamed to **Mjango** to better reflect the quirky protagonist.  
- Built entirely in **C** with **MLX42**.
